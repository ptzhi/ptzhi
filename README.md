Passionate about research in blockhains, DeFi, and TradFi. Currently an investment researcher at [Lumida Wealth Management](lumida.com) focusing on alts and digital assets. Previously a startup builder with 2x defunct projects in FinTech and DeFi, and 1x acquisition exit in AI. 

### Repos
Please check out `lumida-research` repository for portfolio / work samples. `lumida-dev` is a dev env dashboard to play with charts prior to deployment. Ongoing exploration in DeFi and strategies can be found in `defi-primitives` and `strategy-testing`. Other repos are fun projects and will help you get free things.
