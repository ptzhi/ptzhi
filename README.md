## 2. Data Pipeline
*** 
Built pipeline through AWS S3 for TradFi and DeFi data for analysts to use with both Python or Excel. APIs used include Coin Metrics, DefiLlama, Messari Pro, yfinance, IEX, Trading Economics, Coindar.      
For deep dive into Ethereum protocols or double check data, set up Web3.py library and Brownie/Infura Mainnet clone.


## 3. Dashboards
*** 

### Sample Dashboard: [Open Dashboard](http://lumida-dev.herokuapp.com/ "Dashboard")

- L2 Scaling Solutions On-chain Activity (Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism)
- Ethereum Name Service (ENS) Traction
- Multicoin Price Characteristics
- Momentum Strategy Performance

## 4. Strategy Testing
*** 

Tested crypto portfolio strategies that could be executed off-chain with TradFi institutions, focusing on mega-cap tokens in particular BTC. Conducted analysis in Jupyter Lab.

## 5. Portfolio Analysis
*** 
Constructed portfolios across various token parameters, such as market cap tier and category membership, with different portfolio optimization methods such as Markowitz Mean-Variance and inverse rolling volatility.

## 6. CIO Calendar
*** 

**Calendar Webview (static): [Open Calendar](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSdD8Vez3OWVP5aRnBF5Sv7ST8xFBJCs6INSCfk-Thpn7VytqzTqrMoj6qwpxtM3DZJq9KADG3oqFOl/pubhtml?gid=1503319837&single=true "CIO Calendar")**

The goal was to have both important TradFi macro indicators and crypto events at the same place for our co-CIOs to stay up to date on both worlds. The methodology I used was a combination of scraping and Coindar API, fed into Google Sheets.
