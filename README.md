### 1. Token Research
*** 

Conducted preliminary analysis, initial coverage, and ongoing due diligence for tokens, protocols, and themes on client request and internal needs. Selected samples:
- L0s:
  - Polkadot (Preliminary Analysis)
- L1 Smart Chains:
  - Solana (Preliminary Analysis)
  - Cardano (Initial Coverage + Valuation)
- L2 Scaling Solutions:
  - Polygon (Initial Coverage)

  - Optimism (Preliminary Analysis)
- Decentralized Finance:
  - Aave (Preliminary Analysis)
  - Maker (Preliminary Analysis)
- Decentralized Storage:
  - Filecoin (Preliminary Analysis)
  - Arweave (Preliminary Analysis)

### 2. Data Pipeline
*** 

DeFi: Pulled and organized protocol TVL data from DefiLlama   
TradFi: Pulled financial statement and historical data from IEX cloud and yfinance.


### 3. Dashboards
*** 

Sample Dashboard: [Open Dashboard](http://lumida-dev.herokuapp.com/ "Dashboard")

Built dashboards to track macro indicators, strategy performance, and token specific analytics for internal and clients, such as
- L2 Scaling Solutions On-chain Activity (Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism)
- Ethereum Name Service (ENS) Traction
- Multicoin Price Characteristics
- Momentum Strategy Performance

All dashboards were built either in Dash or Excel.

### 4. CIO Calendar
*** 

Sample Calendar: [Open Calendar](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSdD8Vez3OWVP5aRnBF5Sv7ST8xFBJCs6INSCfk-Thpn7VytqzTqrMoj6qwpxtM3DZJq9KADG3oqFOl/pubhtml?gid=1503319837&single=true "CIO Calendar")

The goal was to have both important TradFi macro indicators and crypto events at the same place for our co-CIOs to stay up to date on both worlds. The methodology I used was a combination of scraping and Coindar API, fed into Google Sheets. The sample is a static web snapshot of a filterable workbook.

### 5. Portfolio Analysis
*** 
Sample Markowtiz: See Excel file in repository

Constructed portfolios across various token parameters, such as market cap tier and category membership, with different portfolio optimization methods such as Markowitz Mean-Variance and inverse rolling volatility.

### 6. Strategy Backtesting
*** 

Tested portfolio strategies that could be executed in TradFi, focusing on mega-cap tokens in particular BTC.
