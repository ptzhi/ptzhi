## 6. CIO Calendar

### Calendar Webview (static): [Open Calendar](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSdD8Vez3OWVP5aRnBF5Sv7ST8xFBJCs6INSCfk-Thpn7VytqzTqrMoj6qwpxtM3DZJq9KADG3oqFOl/pubhtml?gid=1503319837&single=true "CIO Calendar")

The goal was to have both important TradFi macro indicators and crypto events at the same place for our co-CIOs to stay up to date on both worlds. The methodology I used was a combination of scraping and Coindar API, fed into Google Sheets.
